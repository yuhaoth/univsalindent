    - [add] Added support for the Visual Basic beautifier VBSBeautifier.
    - [add] Added support for the SQL beautifier Pl/Sql tidy.

    - [fix] Bug ID 3021933: Updated the Artistic Style configuration to support Artistic Style version 2.01.
    - [fix] Bug ID 3021931: Fixed calling of Artistic Style version 1.22 and later.
    - [fix] Bug ID 3006513: Fixed compiling UiGUI using GCC 4.5 and later.
    - [fix] Bug ID 2942381: When loading an indenter configuration file, the settings displayed in the docking widget were correctly updated, but the code wasn't.
    - [fix] Bug ID 2135872: A zombie process kept on running if UiGUI was quit during the update check in background if no internet connection is available.

    - [change] Changed the created shell scripts indenter config file reference. Now each created shell script has a corresponding config file being created in the same dir as the shell script, with the same name but different suffix. But since the config file is referenced by "./", when calling the script the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the config file.
    - [change] Using TCLAP as command line parser instead of own command line parsing.
    - [change] Setting a file name as parameter on the command line without any prefix will load this file instead of the last opened one.
    - [change] Rewritten and improved the internal way how settings are connected to the UI.
    - [change] Refactored and cleaned up the code.
    - [change] Will no longer deliver binary bundles linked against Qt statically. Instead delivering all dependent DLLs and libs.
