				<h1>UniversalIndentGUI</h1>
				<p>... is a cross platform compatible GUI for several code formatter, beautifier and indenter
                   like GreatCode, AStyle (Artistic Styler), GNU Indent, BCPP and so on. Main feature is a live 
                   preview to directly see how the selected formatting option affects the source code.</p>

				<h2>News</h2>
				
				<h3>2007-04-15 Summerlike weather against development ;-)</h3>
				<p>Looking out of my window I can see a clearly blue sky and sunshine. So I look out of the
                window for only a short time and find myself lying on the grass enjoying the warm sunbeams.
                Means developings slows down, but I hope anybody can understand my decision to not
                in front of the computer.</p>
                
                <h3>2007-04-13 Bug in release 0.5.1</h3>
				<p>This version has a bug that causes a crash if a file with an unknown extension is opened.
                Have a look in the forum 
                <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1704191&forum_id=571438">here</a> 
                for details. Next release has this fixed.</p>
				
				<h3>2007-03-21 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.5.1 Beta released</h3>
				<p>Another rounded up number: rechead revision 300. With this release some bugs
                concerning the new QScintilla edit box are fixed and a highlighter for D
                has been added. So no big steps, but keeping on going.</p>
				
				<h3>2007-03-14 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.5.0 Beta released using QScintilla</h3>
                <p>Increasing functionality dramatic! ;-) Using QScintilla as editing component brings a lot
                of comfort with it. It has support for many programming and scripting languages and therefore
                different syntax highlightning, code folding and many more. This release of UniversalIndentGUI
                is a rather hot release, because originally I wanted to test it more before switching to the
                QScintilla-version as release version. But on the other hand I do no longer want to withhold
                it to the public. Hope you enjoy it and give feedback. The AMD64 and win32_installer releases
                of this version will delay a bit due to few time last days.<br>
                And by the way many thanks to Ben Gardner for including support for UniversalIndentGUI in
                Uncrustify (see link on the right) and his and also Nelson Tai's good feedbacks! Could need
                more guys like you.</p>
                
                <h3>2007-03-02 <img src="images/vista_logo_icon_new.png" align="middle" alt="Vista Logo">Vista tested and new development area</h3>
				<p>Since nearly every new computer comes along with Windows Vista installed, I wondered if
                UniversalIndentGUI would be executable on it. And it does. So Vista users, enjoy UIGUI!<br>
                There is a new section at this homepage named "Development", if someone not already noticed
                it. At this page will be shown, where the development in future will lead to. So if you are interested
                in that, have a look. Any suggestions are welcome.</p>
                
                <h3>2007-02-25 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.4.2 Beta released</h3>
				<p>Well actually some more things have happened but could not be updated here because the SourceForge
                server was down. There is a package translation tools in the download area which contains tools 
                for translating UiGUI. These tools and a translation files package for each release
                version with actualized translation files are needed. A taiwan (chinese) translation is
                available since this release (thanks to Nelson Tai). Everybody can feel invited to translate
                UniversalIndentGUI into his native language.</br>
                Further support for CSSTidy has been added. Enjoy it!</p>
                
                <h3>2007-02-11 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.4.1 Beta released</h3>
				<p>As proposed a new indenter has been added: Uncrustify! Give it a try. Also for Linux AMD64 a
                binary will be released from now on.</p>
                
                <h3>2007-02-01 After a while of quiescence: UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.4 Beta released</h3>
				<p>Well its been a bit quiet around my project for a while. Hope everyone had a good start
                into the new year.</br>
                So don't lets waste to many words: a new version is out! As always read the changelog for Details.</br>
                The next aim for UniversalIndentGUI is to add support for Uncrustify, which is promising indenter
                and also available here at SourceForge. And the feature request list has to shrink, so there
                is also some work to do.</br>
                So, let's go!</p>
				
				<h3>2006-09-06 Subversion repository restructured</h3>
				<p>Changed the structure of the subversion repository to be compliant with the quasi standard of 
                subversion repositories. If you want to check out the latest version still use the path 
                https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/universalindent and then not the whole directory but only the 
                trunk dir.</p>
				
				<h3>2006-09-04 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.3.1 Beta released</h3>
				<p>New weekly release with some latency. Missed the pre weekend release but however here
                it is: Version 0.3.1 beta. The only new thing is a program language selector. So if you
                are interested in translating the user interface or just want it in your language,
                leave me note.</p>
                				
				<h3>2006-08-25 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.3 <b>Beta</b> released</h3>
				<p>So far, so good. The project has reached beta state and so most requested features
                are implemented. As allways the changelog shows you all the new things. If anyone finds 
                bugs or annoying, curious behavior let me now to be able to fix it and get forward to
                a stable release. Thanks to all people that have shown interest in the project.</p>
                
				<h3>2006-08-22 Source code documentation online</h3>
				<p>The link on the right leads to the source code documentation generated with doxygen. This will help any interested developers to understand the code.</p>

				<h3>2006-08-11 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.2.5 Alpha released (beta in sight)</h3>
				<p>The weekend comes, a new release comes. With fixing some bugs and adding some
                of the missing features the state of UniversalIndentGUI is progressing to become
                beta soon. There are still feature requests that might be implemented until the beta version
                will be released. Please report any found errors to me.</p>
				
				<h3>2006-08-03 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.2.4 Alpha released</h3>
				<p>With this release the revision stepped beyond 100, so lets celebrate it.<br>
                Some new features are added in this release and some bugs were fixed. For the windows version all dlls
                have become unnecessary, so the package is a bit smaller than before. Please have a look at the 
                changelog for details.</p>
				
				<h3>2006-07-24 Reports and suggestions needed</h3>
				<p>Last week there was no time to continue developing UniversalIndentGUI. Now some steps ahead are 
                needed. So I would be very thankful for any suggestions to make the project reach beta state. This 
                means fix bugs, make it more usable by menu cleanup or more logical stepwise usage. Please use the bug 
                report and feature request functions here at sourceforge for this. <br><br>Now raise your voice!</p>
				
				<h3>2006-07-16 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.2.3 Alpha released</h3>
				<p>Just a little new feature, but it might be helpful. Added possibility to edit the source code 
                while preview is active and see how it is formatted. So that is real live ;-)</p>
				
				<h3>2006-07-14 UniversalIndentGUI Version 0.2.2 Alpha released</h3>
				<p>This release is more an optical fresh up. Some standardized icons are used and a menu bar has been 
                added to provide the common windows usability. Also a rudimentary support for GNU Indent is now 
                present which can be extendend with the use of the ini file format docu.</p>
				
				<h3>2006-07-13 Documentation of ini file fomat online</h3>
				<p>The documentation of the ini file fomat used to describe the parameters of any indenter is online.
                This way you can write your own ini file, perhaps using an existing uigui_*.ini file as draft, and add
                your favorite indenter to use it with UniversalIndentGUI. Please let me know if you wrote an ini file
                for a new indenter or send the file to me so I can add it to the next release.<br>
                If you have any trouble, just ask me in the forum.</p>
				
				<h3>2006-07-07 Version 0.2.1.1 Alpha win32only released</h3>
				<p>This version solves the previous mentioned problems compiling and deploying with Visual Studio 2005
                Express. The new win32 release is compiled with mingw-g++. If there are still problems running
                UniversalIndentGUI tell me.</p>

                <h3>2006-07-07 Problems with missing libraries/dlls under windows</h3>
				<p>There may occur problems running UniversalIndentGUI under windows. In order to run an application 
                built with Visual Studio 2005 you need some librariers, which are available by installing the 
                "Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package". I did'nt know this, and Microsoft makes it not 
                very easy this way, to deploy applications. <br> 
                The needed package for x86 is downloadable by the link:<br> 
                <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&displaylang=en">MS Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package x86</a>
                <br>Perhaps I will compile future versions using mingw gcc to get rid of this problem and not force 
                users to install anything.<br>
                If there are any other problems please let me know, either post in forum or by mail. As fast as 
                possible I will try to fix any bugs.</p>

                <h3>2006-07-04 Version 0.2.1 Alpha released</h3>
				<p>Another little step forward. Have a look at the changelog to see whats new and what has changed.</p>
                
                <h3>2006-06-30 Heureka! Version 0.2.0 Alpha released</h3>
				<p>Ole, ole! Germany wins the match against Argentina and here comes the promised Alpha-version.
                So it would be time for some alpha testing and comments in the forum or buglist. Soon I will
                put a documentation of the ini-file-format online, so anyone can write one for his
                favorite indenter. Or tell me and I will write it, it its not too much work.</p>
                
                <h3>2006-06-30 Version 0.1.3 released</h3>
				<p>Small steps brings you forward... Have a look at the changelog to see whats new. Then download it
                and leave me a note if you want to. I like to read!! ;-)</p>
                
				<h3>2006-06-23 Version 0.1.2 released but still preAlpha </h3>
				<p>Ok I am a liar. This is the next release and it is still preAlpha instead of alpha. It is due to lack
                of time. There are no big feature changes but the technic (format of the ini file) is developing.
                But I wanted to release at least these minor changes to the publicity. Try it!</p>
				
				<h3>2006-06-19 Next Release will be alpha state</h3>
				<p>The planning for a flexible, universal ini file for each indenter is mostly done. The implementation 
                will follow and along with it an ini file for AStyle. With this step the project state will change from 
                preAlpha to Alpha. Release might come this week. I will be happy about any post in the forum!</p>
            
				<h3>2006-06-13 WM and so on</h3>
				<p>The WM here in germany causes some latencies with releases ;-) Means that I am watching more
                soccer than do some programming. But there will be releases, I promise. Hope you enjoy the WM too.</p>
				
				<h3>2006-06-07 PreAlpha release 0.1.1 (Update 2006-06-08)</h3>
				<p>(Update: Had some trouble with the upload so that files were not accessible. Fixed that, so download
				should work now. Enjoy it! ) <br>
                A new version has been released for Windows, Linux and as source code. It is still in an very early state
                but should work to generate a reusable GreatCode config file. See Docs or readme.txt in release.</p>

				<h3>2006-06-05 Website is online</h3>
				<p>The website went online with short info about the UniversalIndentGUI</p>

				<h3>2006-06-02 First release of UniversalIndentGUI</h3>
				<p>A first version of the UniversalIndentGUI for win32 has been released. Give it a try and if you want, useful comments. Remember this is a very, very pre release and will undergo many changes ;-)</p>

				<h3>2006-05-19 Startup of UniversalIndentGUI</h3>
				<p>Soon here will be more activity and also a first version and documentation of my tool. From now on it supports only the indenter GreatCode, which I have only compiled for Windows. So there has to be done some work to make all more flexible for more indenters and beautifiers. Stay tuned for upcoming code, news and so on...</p>
