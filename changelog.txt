2006-07-14 Version 2.2 Alpha
- added ini file for GNU Indent with some first settings (if any one wants to write more in it let me know)
- added a menu bar for more pleasent and common use of the program (some not yet used menu items are disabled)
- added an about dialog
- added some icons for better look and feel (can you feel it ;-) )
- fixed a bug under linux which caused an endless loop if text was edited

2006-07-07 Version 0.2.1.1 Alpha (win32 only)
- previously compiled using Visual Studio 2005 Express, whereby an additional installation of a redistributable package was needed to run UniversalIndentGUI. To avoid this and not force the user to install anything, now using mingw to compile.

2006-07-04 Version 0.2.1 Alpha
- added function to load config file (not the uigui ini file) of every indenter (and reenabled load config file button)
- added use of a default value when loading a indenter config file and not all parameters are set.
- added all documented default parameters of GreatCode and Astyle to their ini files.
- fixed loading of file mask for source code file after changing indenter
- fixed call of indenter failed under win32 if a linux binary exists.

2006-06-30 Version 0.2.0 Alpha
- added missing parameters for flexible indenter ini file format
- added complete Astyle ini file
- added multiple choice combobox for parameters
- added checkbox in front of numeric and string parameters to enable/disable them. If disabled indenters default value is used

2006-06-28
- added working ini file for Astyle (right now only few boolean parameters)
- changed ini file format for booleans to reach the planned flexibility

2006-06-23
- added combobox in the upper left showing available indenters (found by searching for uigui_*.ini file). at the moment only GreatCode and testwise Astyle
- added more detailed info if the indenter call results in an error
- added icon for executable
- changed style/format of the ini file. Still not all planned features implemented
- some bugfixes, as you can say this in a preAlpha

2006-06-07
- unnecessary gui menu removed
- corrected ini file for great code (only in executable release)
- made call of windows version of GreatCode under Linux possible by using wine
